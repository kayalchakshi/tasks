                    <h1>Cherry</h1>
                    <p>Cherries are stone fruits - just like their friends the apricots. 
                        A cherry tree can carry on producing fruit for 100 years! 
                        Cherries grow from stalks in pairs. Ahhh! Sweet ones like the Bing 
                        cherry are nicest on their own or in a fruit salad. 
                        Sour ones like Morello cherries are tastier cooked.</p>

                    <h1>Nuts</h1>
                    <p>Your brain looks like a giant walnut. 
                        To make it grow it needs protein, which is found in nuts!
                        A nut is actually a fruit, or the seed of a fruit. 
                        There are lots of different kinds but they all have a hard, 
                        dry shell around a kernel (the part of the nut you eat). 
                        A Brazil nut tree can live for 500 years!</p>

                    <h1>Broccoli</h1>
                    <p>Broccoli is closely related to cabbage - and it's another 
                        one of those 'greens' we're always being told to eat up. 
                        The part of a broccoli plant we normally eat is the lovely 
                        flowerhead - the flowers are usually green but sometimes purple. 
                        Steamed broccoli is tasty in a salad or stir-fry.</p>

                    <h1>Avocado</h1>
                    <p>It is sometimes called an avocado pear. 
                        Avocado is often mistaken for a vegetable because 
                        we eat it like a salad vegetable, but it is actually a fruit. 
                        Avocados are at their best when they are ripe and very easy to prepare. 
                        They can simply be cut in half with the stone removed and eaten 
                        with a little salad dressing or chopped into a salad. 
                        Avocados are a good source of essential fats (the good ones) - 
                        one of the few fruits or vegetables that contain fat.</p>

                    <h1>Fennel</h1>
                    <p>This vegetable tastes a bit like liquorice! 
                        Fennel is a plant that grows in the ground. 
                        A bulb shape grows at the base of the plant, 
                        and this is the part that you eat. Raw fennel adds a 
                        super crunchy taste to salads. You can also slice it and cook 
                        it like onion or celery to use in casseroles. 
                        The feathery leaves and seeds add flavouring to cooking, just like herbs.</p>
